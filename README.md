<p>This is an interactive website regarding tourist information about the County Dublin, in Ireland. 
The start of this website begins with an image of Dublin city center. 
As the user scrolls down the page, they are greeted with a brief introduction of the city of Dublin, 
followed by two clickable buttons which highlight markers on the Javascript Google maps API 
of tourist attractions and outdoor activites that users may be interested in upon visiting the county of Dublin. 
Underneath the Google Maps API is followed by a carousel of city center attractions, an accordion of restaurant 
and pubs and then another carousel of outdoor activites to do in Dublin. 
Lastly an emailJS API is used for users who have queries about site information.
The user can also access the fixed navigation bar to choose a section of interest to them from attractions, outdoor activites, 
restaurants and good pubs to visit in Dublin.</p>

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
* The two main colours used are white, dark grey, red because it makes content easily readable because of contrasting colours and allows users to understand where a section starts and ends.

#### Typography
* The two main fonts chosen for the website are Lato and Sans-seriff.

#### Imagery
The imagery on the site is important. The site will include  a main hero image which is designed to catch the user's
 attention and entice a user to continue to scroll down the page or use the navigation bar to choose the content they are looking for.
 The carousels also contain 10 high definition photos to entice users to do certain activities or visit certain places.

### Wireframes

* Desktop Page Wireframe - [View](wireframes/desktop-wireframe.pdf)

* Mobile Wireframe - [View](wireframes/mobile-wireframe.pdf)

### Features 
* The website is responsive on all device sizes.
* The website is interactive and allows users to click butons to recieve their desired outcome, submit any queries they may have or view certain places, things to do or images they may be interested in.
* Implement weather forecast over several days and style the weather icons to be more visually appealing. The site owner could not do this due to time constraints.

### Features to be implemented
* In the future, this site should implement the Google Maps radius feature that fetches potential things for a user to visit or do while they are in Dublin giving the users current location.
* A gallery should be included with further images of the city of Dublin.
